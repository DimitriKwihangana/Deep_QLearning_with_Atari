# Deep Q-Learning with Atari [(Video Link)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZdCODAwb2h0Kl1zGzK1hkf5l8Pa9aS33/view?usp=sharing)

## 📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to train an RL agent to play an Atari game by utilizing Stable Baselines3 and Gymnasium in conjunction with Deep Q-Learning. Training the agent and then assessing its performance with a trained model comprise the project.
## 🎮 Environment Selection
We selected an Atari game from the Gymnasium collection for training and evaluation. The environment provides a challenging yet structured reinforcement learning task that enables the agent to improve over time through deep Q-learning.

## 📜 Training Scripts
### 1️⃣ Training Script (train.py)
This script is responsible for training the DQN agent and saving the trained model for later evaluation.

**Key Steps:**
- Define the DQN agent using Stable Baselines3.
- Train the agent with different hyperparameters.
- Save the trained model as `dqn_model.zip`.
- Log training details such as reward trends and episode length.

### 2️⃣ Playing Script (play.py)
This script loads the trained model and runs the agent in the environment for evaluation.

**Key Steps:**
- Load the trained DQN model.
- Use GreedyQPolicy to ensure optimal action selection.
- Render and visualize the game performance.

## 📊 Hyperparameter Tuning
| Hyperparameters | Observed Behavior |
|---------------|------------------|
| lr=1e-4, gamma=0.99, batch=32, eps=0.1 → 0.01 | Initial training was slow with limited exploration. |
| lr=5e-4, gamma=0.99, batch=64, eps=0.2 → 0.01 | Faster learning and better strategy development. |
| lr=1e-3, gamma=0.95, batch=128, eps=0.3 → 0.05 | Faster initial learning but unstable in later episodes. |

## 🚀 Challenges Faced
1️⃣ **Training on CPU was slow** – We leveraged GPU resources for faster training.
2️⃣ **Rendering issues in headless environments** – We recorded gameplay for later evaluation.

## 🎬 Evaluation: Running play.py
After training, the agent was evaluated based on gameplay performance. The trained agent demonstrated improved decision-making and higher rewards compared to the baseline model.


## 🎯 Conclusion
This project successfully trained an RL agent using Deep Q-Learning to play an Atari game. By tuning hyperparameters and evaluating performance, we demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in complex environments. Future work could explore alternative RL algorithms such as PPO or A2C for comparison.
